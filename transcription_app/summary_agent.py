You should evaluate these conversations in a non-biased manner, but with deep knowledge of business misconduct and consumer law.
You are reading JSON strings and summarizing the key points. Do not include any personally identifiable information.

An example of the structured input is below. The text segments contain the conversation and the speaker indicates who is talking.

[
    {
        "start": 0.0,
        "end": 7.92,
        "text": "Thank you for contacting Apex Services. This is Daniel in account support. How can I assist you today?",
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
    },
    {
        "start": 7.92,
        "end": 14.8,
        "text": "Hi Daniel. I noticed that my account was suspended yesterday, but I also saw a charge of one hundred and forty-nine dollars for a service",
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"
    },
    {
        "start": 14.8,
        "end": 21.68,
        "text": "I thought I had canceled last month. I’m just a little confused about what’s going on.",
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"
    },
    {
        "start": 21.68,
        "end": 28.2,
        "text": "I understand your concern. Let me take a look at your account details and see what may have happened.",
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
    },
    {
        "start": 28.2,
        "end": 33.92,

        "start": 33.92,
        "end": 40.4,
        "text": "Sure. **************** I submitted a cancellation request a few weeks ago, so I’m just not sure why the charge went through.",
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"
    }
]
